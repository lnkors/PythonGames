my_function()

# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
#The loop is printing You got this if i is equal to 20
# 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
#When i = 20
# 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
#The assumption is made that i will eventually equal 20, but this is incorrect since the range is set equal to 20 which means it will only loop to 19
